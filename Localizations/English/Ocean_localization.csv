"Localization files are formatted like CSV so they can be easily edited,
however formatting has strict rules for easy parsing. Most of these rules
are already handled by Excel / Libre / etc., so you don't have to worry
about them in normal usage. However, if your localization file seems to
be corrupted, these rules may be helpful for debugging purposes...
- In general, any consecutive string of \r and \n (in any order) will be
  treated as one SINGLE line break, except within an enclosed context
- The first 4 rows can be arbitrarily long
  - The first cell of first row is used to store this block of instruction
    text
  - The first 3 cells of the fourth row is used as headers
  - All other cells in the first and fourth rows are ignored
  - Columns in the second row alternate between property and value (ex.
    ' foo | 1 | bar | 3.5 | ... '
    - Any whitespaces before and after the property name are ignored
  - Columns in the third row are exclusively comments for properties in the
    second row
- Every following line can include any number of cells, but only the
  first three will be parsed (you can use the rest as comments if needed)
- The file must end in a sequence of \r and \n's
- Every cell containing a ^, \r, or \n must be enclosed in ""
  - If a "" is encountered right after a non-enclosed separator, \r, or \n,
    then the parser is said to enter an ""enclosed context"", such context
    ends immediately when a non-escaped "" that is not followed by \r, \n,
    or a separator is encountered
  - "" within each cell should be escaped using another "" in front of it,
  - If a "" is encountered in a non-enclosed context, and it is not right
    after a separator, \r, or \n, then it is entirely ignored
  - If a non-escaped "" is encountered in an enclosed context...
    - If it is followed by a separator, \r, or \n, then it is considered
      the closing quote of the current context
    - Otherwise, it is ignored
  - If a separator, \r, or \n is encountered while in an enclosed context,
    it will be preserved
